# Web Study 🌐

Hey there! Welcome to my **Web Exploration Repository**.  

This is where I’ll be documenting everything as I dive into the world of the web 
from the basics of how it all works, to building things, breaking things, and learning how to secure them.  

Here’s what you can expect:  
- **Web Fundamentals**: The building blocks of the internet.  
- **Web Development**: Frontend, backend
- **Web Hacking**: Finding and understanding vulnerabilities 
- **Web Pentesting**: Testing, breaking, and securing web apps 

## Why I’m Doing This 🚀

I wanted a place to:  
1. Keep track of what I’m learning.  
2. Share useful tips and resources.  
3. Build a space where I can look back and see how far I’ve come.  

If you’re into this kind of stuff, enjoy it!

## What’s Inside 🛠️

- **Notes/**: All the stuff I’ve learned along the way
- **Projects/**: Little (and big) experiments I’ll work on  
- **Resources/**: Handy links, tools, and things I’ve found useful
- **Challenges/**: Practice exercises and my attempts at solving them  

## Let’s Connect 🤝

Feel free to follow along, share ideas, or open a pull request if you’ve got something cool to add. This is as much about sharing the journey as it is about learning.
